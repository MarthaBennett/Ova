# Ova

### What is it?

An app to help people get diagnosed with Endometriosis, Adenomyosis, PCOS and related health conditions sooner.

### How does it work?

Log your symptoms in your diary to build up a data set that doctors can't ignore. 

Ova helps you to track the frequency, severity, location and type of pain to help make a case for investigations.

Ova is not intended to be a diagnostic or medical tool in itself: it is to assist patients in making a case for further exploration with their GP or a gynaecologist.

### What are the features?

- Diary to log symptoms
- Personal profile showing symptom data trends
- Information about common gynaecological conditions
- Diagnosis and treatment pathway information 
- Case studies and stories of hope

### Why does Ova exist?

In the UK, it currently takes an average of 8 years for someone to be diagnosed with Endometriosis. 

Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 people with wombs so it is as common as Asthma or Diabetes, yet there is very little research or funding awarded to the condition. There are over 178 million people living with Endometriosis in the world today.

In lieu of a biomarker, a cure or updates in the way conditions like Endometriosis are taught in medical school, tech can help us create a data set that cannot be dismissed.

We're Ova it.
