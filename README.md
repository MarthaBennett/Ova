# Ova

### What is it?

An app to help people get diagnosed with Endometriosis, Adenomyosis, PCOS and related health conditions sooner.

### How does it work?

Log your symptoms in your diary to build up a data set that doctors can't ignore. 

Ova helps you to track the frequency, severity, location and type of pain to help make a case for investigations.

Ova is not intended to be a diagnostic or medical tool in itself: it is to assist patients in making a case for further exploration with their GP or a gynaecologist.

### What are the features?

- Diary to log symptoms
- Personal profile showing symptom data trends
- Information about common gynaecological conditions
- Diagnosis and treatment pathway information 
- Case studies and stories of hope

### Why does Ova exist?

In the UK, it currently takes an average of 8 years for someone to be diagnosed with Endometriosis. 

Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 people with wombs so it is as common as Asthma or Diabetes, yet there is very little research or funding awarded to the condition. There are over 178 million people living with Endometriosis in the world today.

Endometriosis is not life-threatening, but it is life-limiting. It can compromise someone's fertility, prevent them from working or socialising and/or cause a host of unpleasant symptoms such as vomiting, fainting, painful sex, migraines, depression, bowel issues, acute pain month-round and nerve damage. 

It took me 14 years, over 30 GPs and 10 gynaecologists, losing jobs, partners and the ability to walk before I was diagnosed with Endometriosis. It was a further 3 years before I received medical care on the NHS. I'm keen to make sure that those coming after me do not have to fight so hard for a diagnosis and care.

In lieu of a biomarker, a cure or updates in the way conditions like Endometriosis are taught in medical school, tech can help us create a data set that cannot be dismissed.

We're all Ova it.
